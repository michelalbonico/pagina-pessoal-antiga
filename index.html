 I am an Adjunct Professor (between assistant and associate) at the Technological Federal University of Paraná (UTFPR), Brazil, where I teach software engineering and distributed applications. I also lead the research group  (IntelAgir), as well as technological and research projects. After a long period of studies in Brazil, I held my Ph.D. degree in Software Engineering from the IMT Atlantique, Nantes, France. I also worked for one year as a postdoc researcher at the S2 Group/VU Amsterdam, the Netherlands, where I am still working as an external researcher. My current research focuses on empirical software engineering for cyber-physical systems (more specifically IoT and Robotics), but I also work on end-user programming and active learning methodologies.             </p>
            <!--p>
                My carrier has always been driven by curiosity, courage, and a bit of madness.
                Nowadays, I'm an adjunct (between assistant and associated) professor at the Federal University of Technology, Paraná - <b>UTFPR</b> (Francisco Beltrão, Brazil). But the story is l onger than that...
                I started my carrier as an office boy and while in the office I had the opportunity to work with what was love at first sight, computers.
                Computers need to be connected, right!? - at least I am not that old - We had some Linux servers there, so I met my second love (yeah, I have human loves as well),
                 <b>open-source software and Linux</b>. I have been Linux user (mostly exclusively) since 2003. Linux also drove me through infrastructure/internet provider, where
                 I worked as a network/content manager. Well, then, I started my academic carrier. I had a great opportunity to work as a bachelor lecturer since 2008 when I only held a specialization degree (in Brazil, it is a kind of professional degree in a specific subarea).
                 During this, I did my Master degree at <b>UFPR (Curitiba, Brazil)</b>, which led to a Junior/Assistant Professor position at UTFPR (Francisco Beltrão, Brazil), where I hold a tenured position now.
                 During my first years at UTFPR, I did a Ph.D. (on leave) in Software Engineering/Distributed Systems at the <b>IMT Atlantique (Nantes, France)</b>. 
                 Awesome life and professional experience.
                 Being at UTFPR also keeps my learning horizon wide. 
                 In 2020 I started as a postdoctoral researcher in the S2 Group, at <b>VU Amsterdam (Amsterdam, the Netherlands)</b>, mostly online given the COVID-19 pandemic.
                 Then, in 2021, I had the privilege to work on-site for one month with that wonderful team. Another super great period of learning and friendship. 
                OK, I forgot to say that when it comes to research, my interest lays in <b>empirical software engineering</b>, <b>software engineering practice</b>, and <b>distributed software architectures</b>... not limited to that.
                 I am always <b>open to collaboration</b> and new adventures...

                <h2><a href="#" target="_blank">Software Engineering</a></h2>
                <p>We're modernizing this. The plan is to split it into multiple credits. For now, I'm teaching generic SE, with a focus on software construction, validation, and documentation. Modern SE practice is also worked intensively.</p>

                <p>I teach first-period students how and why to use programming languages. Usually, I mix Scratch (logic), C (Hello, world!), and Arduino (sensitive case studies with robots).</p>
                
                <h2><a href="https://github.com/michelalbonico/AD37L" target="_blank">Distributed Applications</a></h2>
                <p>Basics of distributed systems, and case study projects. Java is the main language here (threads, synchronization, remote calls, WebSockets, etc.), 
                    with some coding with the Spring framework. 
                    The course also presents some advanced aspects, such as frontend and backend separations, application framework (Spring), REST, RPC, and messaging protocols (MQTT, WebSockets, etc.). 
                    At the end of the course, the students must deliver their own distributed application. </p>
